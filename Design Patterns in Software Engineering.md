# Design Patterns in Software Engineering

## Creational Patterns

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface to create families of related or dependent objects.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object (a prototype).

## Structural Patterns

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation so the two can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible.
- **Proxy**: Provides a placeholder for another object to control access.

## Behavioral Patterns

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- **Interpreter**: Implements a grammar interpreter.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an objectâ€™s internal state.
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects when the state changes.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor**: Lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
