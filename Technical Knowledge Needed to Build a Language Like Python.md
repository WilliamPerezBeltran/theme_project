# Technical Knowledge Needed to Build a Language Like Python

## 1. **Computer Science Fundamentals**
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees, graphs, sorting/searching algorithms.
- **Memory Management**: Stack vs heap, garbage collection, reference counting.
- **Compilers & Interpreters**: Lexing, parsing, abstract syntax trees (AST), bytecode generation, execution.

## 2. **Programming Language Theory**
- **Syntax & Semantics**: Grammar rules, context-free grammars, formal languages.
- **Type Systems**: Static vs dynamic typing, strong vs weak typing.
- **Runtime Environments**: Virtual machines, interpreters, JIT compilation.

## 3. **Low-Level Programming**
- **C/C++**: Most language runtimes (including CPython) are written in C.
- **Assembly Basics**: Understanding how code interacts with the CPU.
- **System Calls & OS Internals**: File handling, process management, I/O operations.

## 4. **Compiler/Interpreter Tools**
- **Lexical Analyzers**: Tools like `flex` or writing your own tokenizer.
- **Parser Generators**: Tools like `bison`, `ANTLR`, or hand-written parsers.
- **Intermediate Representations (IR)**: Translating code into a form for optimization or interpretation.

## 5. **Standard Library & Ecosystem**
- Building a robust **standard library** with file I/O, networking, math, and string handling.
- **Package Management**: System like `pip` for Python.

## 6. **Optimization & Performance**
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: Concepts used by PyPy, Java HotSpot, etc.
- **Profiling & Benchmarking**: Measuring and improving performance.
- **Concurrency & Parallelism**: Threads, async I/O, multiprocessing.

## 7. **Community & Maintenance**
- **Version Control**: Git, branching strategies.
- **Open Source Governance**: Managing contributions, PEP-like proposals.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Unit testing, integration testing, regression testing.

**Tip**: A good starting point is to study the source code of [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) and implement a minimal interpreter in C for a toy language.
