I screwed up 2 interviews because I couldn't explain my projects properly.

Here is how you can explain your project in an interview

When you’re in an interview, it’s super important to know how to talk about your projects in a way that impresses the interviewer. Here are some key points to help you do just that:

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄: 
 - Start with a quick summary of the project you worked on. What was it all about? What were the main goals? Keep it short and sweet something you can explain in about 30 seconds.

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: 
 - What problem were you trying to solve with this project? Explain why this problem was important and needed addressing.

➤ 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 
 - Describe the solution you came up with. How does it work, and why is it a good fix for the problem?

➤ 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗥𝗼𝗹𝗲: 
 - Talk about what you specifically did. What were your main tasks? Did you face any challenges, and how did you overcome them? Make sure it’s clear whether you were leading the project, a key player, or supporting the team.

➤ 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀: 
 - Mention the tech and tools you used. This shows your technical know-how and your ability to choose the right tools for the job.

➤ 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: 
 - Share the results of your project. Did it make things better? How? Mention any improvements, efficiencies, or positive feedback you got. This helps show the project was a success and highlights your contribution.

➤ 𝗧𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: 
 - If you worked with a team, talk about how you collaborated. What was your role in the team? How did you communicate and contribute to the team’s success?

➤ 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: 
 - Reflect on what you learned from the project. How did it help you grow professionally? What new skills did you gain, and what would you do differently next time?

➤ 𝗧𝗶𝗽𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:
 - Be ready with a 30 second elevator pitch about your projects, and also have a five-minute detailed overview ready.
 - Know why you chose the project, what your role was, what decisions you made, and how the results compared to what you expected.
 - Be clear on the scope of the project whether it was a long-term effort or a quick task.
 - If there’s a pause after you describe the project, don’t hesitate to ask if they’d like more details or if there’s a specific part they’re interested in.

Remember, 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗸𝗲𝘆. You might have done great work, but if you don’t explain it well, it’s hard for the interviewer to understand your impact. So, practice explaining your projects with clarity.
