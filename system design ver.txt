If you're struggling with system design interviews, then to be honest you’re not alone and with so many concepts to learn, it’s very easy to feel overwhelmed. 

 

BUT here’s the good news, you don’t actually need to know everything to ace the interview. In fact, 80% of system design interviews focus on just 20% of the topics (I know, hard to believe). 

 

My guide (which I am very proud of) zeroes in on those key areas, helping you focus your efforts on what really matters. With a clear roadmap, you'll be better prepared and increase your chances of success!
