Java_interview
The CTS interview for AMEX was all about testing Java fundamentals, Spring Boot expertise, and real world problem solving skills. It wasn’t easy, but with the right preparation, it’s totally crackable. Here’s a breakdown of the toughest questions I faced and tips to help you 
Duration - 90 mins

Core Java Questions
 1. How does a HashMap handle collisions, and what’s the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap?
 2. Explain Garbage Collection—what’s the deal with G1 GC vs. CMS?
 3. What’s the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?
 4. How would you implement an immutable class with mutable fields?
 5. What are soft references, weak references, and phantom references in Java, and why do they matter?

 Multithreading and Concurrency
 1. What’s a race condition, and how would you prevent it?
 2. How does the Fork/Join framework work, and when would you use it?
 3. What are CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier, and how do they differ?
 4. Implement a producer-consumer pattern using Java’s BlockingQueue.
 5. How would you debug a deadlock in a multithreaded application?

 Spring Boot Questions
 1. What’s the role of Spring Boot Actuator, and why is it useful?
 2. How does Spring Boot’s auto-configuration work under the hood?
 3. Explain AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) with a real-world example.
 4. How do you secure a REST API with Spring Security and JWT?
 5. What’s the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller?

 API and Microservices
 1. How would you implement rate limiting in a microservices architecture?
 2. What’s the difference between asynchronous APIs and synchronous APIs?
 3. Explain the role of Eureka and Zuul in Spring Cloud.
 4. How do you ensure backward compatibility with API versioning?
 5. Design a retry mechanism for a failing API call in a distributed system.

Coding Challenges

Challenge 1: Write a program to detect cycles in a directed graph using DFS.
Challenge 2: Implement an LRU Cache in Java using LinkedHashMap.
Challenge 3: Find the top K frequent elements in an unsorted array.
Challenge 4: Serialize and deserialize a binary tree.
Challenge 5: Reverse a linked list both iteratively and recursively.

Advanced Topics
 1. How would you debug a memory leak in a production Java application?
 2. Explain CAP theorem and its relevance to distributed systems.
 3. How does event-driven architecture work with Kafka?
 4. Redis vs. Memcached: Which one do you pick for caching, and why?
 5. How do you monitor and troubleshoot issues in a microservices architecture?
